#### By _**Sammai Gutierrez**_

## Technologies Used

* _GitHub_
* _VS Code_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _GitBash_
* _jQuery_

## Description

_In brief, this project shows the utilization of basic loops_

## _Test-Driven Development_

1.  First test

    + Test: "It should return _"Won't you be my neighbor?"_ if number 3 is an element of an array."
    + Describe: exeptionThree(usersNumbers, exeption)
    + Code:
      + const usersNumbers = [0,1,2,3]
      + exeptionThree(usersNumbers, 3)
    + Expected Output: _"Won't you be my neighbor?"_

2.  Second test

    + Test: "If numbers 1, 2, or 3 are elements of the array, the return should be "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?" respectively. 
    + Describe: exeptionsFinder(usersNumbers, exeption)
    + Code:
      + const usersNumbers = [0,1,2,3]
      + exeptionsFinder(usersNumbers, 2)
    + Expected Output: _"Boop!"_

3.  Third test

    + Test: "It should separate more than one digit numbers, and store them into an array.
    + Describe: splitMoreThanOneDigitNumbers(digit)
    + Code:
      + splitMoreThanOneDigitNumbers(7721)
    + Expected Return: [7,7,2,1]

3.  Fourth test

    + Test: "It should print all numbers that are not exception."
